Hi, my name is Vasant Goswami and I'm a freshman at the University of Missouri-Columbia majoring in Inforamtion Technology. I come from a small town in Missouri called Nevada. At a very young age I was interested in computers and just random tech because of my cousins and friends. I love to play video games especially on my PC. I chose IT as my major because it seemed like the best path for me and the things I want to do later in my life. This is just a little about myself.
